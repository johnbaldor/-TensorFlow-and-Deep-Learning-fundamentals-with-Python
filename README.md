Overview


classification.ipynb:
Focuses on binary classification using synthetic circular data.
Explores various neural network architectures, including different layers and activation functions.
Evaluates models and visualizes decision boundaries for performance insights.


regression.ipynb:
Covers regression tasks with synthetic and real-world data 
Demonstrates training, tuning, and evaluating models with different optimizers and architectures.
Uses normalization techniques and plots loss curves for visualizing model improvement.


TensorBasics.ipynb:
Provides an introduction to TensorFlow tensor operations.
Covers tensor creation, manipulation, and basic operations such as reshaping, transposing, and one-hot encoding.
Explores tensor properties, including shape, rank, and typecasting for computational tasks.
